# Explanation:
# Initialization: The ProcessBase class initializes with an Orchestrator instance, which it will use to manage the execution of the process.

# Abstract Methods:

# define_agents(): To be implemented by subclasses to specify the agents involved.
# define_tasks(): To be implemented by subclasses to specify the tasks.
# define_workflow(): To be implemented by subclasses to define how agents and tasks are orchestrated.
# Instance Methods:

# add_agent(agent): Adds an agent to the process.
# add_task(task): Adds a task to the process.
# set_workflow(workflow): Sets the workflow, which includes agent-task interactions and execution sequence.
# execute(): Uses the Orchestrator to run the defined workflow.
# Representation: The __repr__ method provides a string representation of the ProcessBase instance, showing its agents, tasks, and workflow.

# You can extend this base class to create specific process implementations by overriding the abstract methods to define how agents, tasks, and workflows should be set up.
