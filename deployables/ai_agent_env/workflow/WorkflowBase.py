# Explanation:
# Initialization: Initializes with an Orchestrator instance, which will handle the execution of the workflow.

# Abstract Methods:

# define_agents(): To be implemented by subclasses to specify the agents involved in the workflow.
# define_tasks(): To be implemented by subclasses to specify the tasks.
# define_workflow(): To be implemented by subclasses to define the specific workflow, including how agents and tasks interact.
# Instance Methods:

# add_agent(agent): Adds an agent to the workflow.
# add_task(task): Adds a task to the workflow.
# set_workflow(workflow): Sets the workflow, detailing agent-task interactions and execution order.
# execute(): Uses the Orchestrator to run the defined workflow. Raises an error if the workflow is not defined.
# Representation: The __repr__ method provides a string representation of the WorkflowBase instance, showing its agents, tasks, and workflow.

# You would create subclasses of WorkflowBase to define specific workflows for different processes. Each subclass would implement the define_agents(), define_tasks(), and define_workflow() methods to detail how the workflow should be structured and executed.
