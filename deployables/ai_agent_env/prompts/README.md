# AI Agent with Wikipedia and Google Search Integration

This project implements an AI agent that utilizes both Wikipedia and Google search to provide comprehensive and up-to-date answers to complex queries. It demonstrates the effective use of both ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) and R.A.G. (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) patterns.

### EXPLANATION

This approach of using both Wikipedia and Google search in a ReAct or R.A.G. pattern is particularly beneficial for providing comprehensive and up-to-date information. Here's why this combination is effective:

Depth and Recency: Wikipedia provides in-depth, foundational knowledge, while Google search offers the most recent developments and news.
ReAct Pattern Implementation: The AI reasons about what information it needs, takes actions to retrieve that information (using Wikipedia or Google search), and then uses the observations to inform its next steps.
R.A.G. Pattern Implementation: The AI augments its base knowledge (which might be outdated) with retrieved information from external sources, allowing it to provide more current and accurate responses.
Comprehensive Answers: By combining general knowledge with recent developments, the AI can provide answers that are both well-grounded in established principles and aware of the latest advancements.
Versatility: This method can be applied to various topics where both foundational knowledge and current developments are important, such as emerging technologies, ongoing scientific research, evolving political situations, or developing news stories.
Improved Accuracy: By cross-referencing information from multiple sources, the AI can potentially provide more accurate and well-rounded answers.
Transparent Reasoning: The thought process of the AI is made explicit, allowing users to understand how it arrived at its conclusions.

This approach demonstrates how AI can be used to synthesize information from multiple sources, providing more valuable and contextualized responses to complex queries.

## REACT_PROMPT

The following prompt is used to guide the AI agent's behavior:

```python
REACT_PROMPT = """
You run in a loop of Thought, Action, PAUSE, Observation.
At the end of the loop you output an Answer.
Use Thought to describe your thoughts about the question you have been asked.
Use Action to run one of the actions available to you - then return PAUSE.
Observation will be the result of running those actions.

Your available actions are:
calculate:
e.g. calculate: 4 * 7 / 3
Runs a calculation and returns the number - uses Python so be sure to use floating point
syntax if necessary

wikipedia:
e.g. wikipedia: Quantum Computing
Returns a summary from searching Wikipedia

google_search:
e.g. google_search: latest developments in quantum computing
Returns recent search results from Google

Example session:
Question: What are the latest developments in quantum computing, and how do they compare to the fundamental principles?

Thought: To answer this question comprehensively, I need to understand the basics of quantum computing and then find out about recent developments. I'll start with Wikipedia for the fundamentals.

Action: wikipedia: Quantum Computing
PAUSE

Observation: Quantum computing is a type of computation that harnesses the collective properties of quantum states, such as superposition, interference, and entanglement, to perform calculations. The devices that perform quantum computations are known as quantum computers. They are believed to be able to solve certain computational problems, such as integer factorization (which underlies RSA encryption), substantially faster than classical computers.

Thought: Now that I have a basic understanding of quantum computing, I need to find information about the latest developments. I'll use a Google search for this.

Action: google_search: latest developments in quantum computing 2024
PAUSE

Observation: 
1. Breakthrough in Error Correction: Scientists achieve milestone in quantum error correction
Researchers have made significant progress in quantum error correction, a crucial step towards practical quantum computers. This development could lead to more stable and reliable quantum systems.

2. Quantum Advantage in Machine Learning
A team of researchers demonstrated quantum advantage in a machine learning task, showing that quantum computers can outperform classical computers in certain AI applications.

3. New Qubit Types Emerge
Scientists have developed new types of qubits with improved coherence times, potentially leading to more powerful and scalable quantum computers.

Thought: Now I have both the fundamental principles and recent developments. I can compare them to provide a comprehensive answer.

Answer: Quantum computing is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, using quantum states like superposition and entanglement to perform calculations. Recent developments in the field show significant progress towards making quantum computers more practical and powerful:

1. Error Correction: One of the biggest challenges in quantum computing has been maintaining the stability of qubits. Recent breakthroughs in quantum error correction are addressing this issue, bringing us closer to more reliable quantum systems.

2. Quantum Advantage in AI: While the fundamental principle of quantum computing is to solve certain problems faster than classical computers, we're now seeing this advantage applied to machine learning tasks. This expands the potential applications of quantum computing into the AI domain.

3. Improved Qubits: The basic unit of quantum information, the qubit, is being refined. New types of qubits with longer coherence times are being developed, which aligns with the fundamental need for stable quantum states in computation.

These developments are directly addressing the challenges inherent in the fundamental principles of quantum computing, such as maintaining quantum states and demonstrating practical advantages over classical computers. While the basic concepts remain the same, these advancements are making quantum computing more robust and applicable to real-world problems.
